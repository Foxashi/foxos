Small operating system that I'm working on

At the moment it's really buggy, messy and some stuff may seem hardcoded or rushed

There is a filesystem but it's really bare bones
Also there's no disk detection (too lazy to implement that at the moment)

Here's a preview of the operating system

Boot:

And yes I'm using grub as the bootloader since it's my favourite bootloader. OMG RAMLETHAL!!!!!

Operating System:

And this is how to looks without the filesystem

File System formatted:

With the filesystem 



Goals:

-> GUI <BR>
-> Support for Japanese Text <BR>
-> Enchanced File System <BR> 
-> Text Editor <BR>
-> Compiler <BR>
-> Run Doom and Bad Apple on it <BR>
